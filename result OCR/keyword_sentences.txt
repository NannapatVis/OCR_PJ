Page 18, Paragraph 1: “Irene’s photograph!” he cried. “Certainly, if you wish it.”
“I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honor to
wish you a very good-morning.” He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand
which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.
And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how
the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman’s wit. He used to make
merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he
speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the
honorable title of the woman.
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and
found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with
fiery red hair. With an **apology** for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes
pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.
“You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,” he said cordially.
“I was afraid that you were engaged.”
“So I am. Very much so.”
“Then I can wait in the next room.”
“Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my
most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours
also.”
The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little
questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.
“Try the settee,” said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips
together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. “I know, my dear Watson, that you
share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of
everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted
you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of
my own little adventures.”
“Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,” I observed.
“You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very
simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and
extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than
any effort of the imagination.”
“A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.”
“You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall
keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and
acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call
upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most
singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the
Page 65, Paragraph 1: side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was deep in
one of Clark Russell’s fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to
blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea
waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother’s, and for a few days I was a dweller once
more in my old quarters at Baker Street.
“Why,” said I, glancing up at my companion, “that was surely the bell. Who could come
to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?”
“Except yourself I have none,” he answered. “I do not encourage visitors.”
“A client, then?”
“If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such
an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady’s.”
Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the
passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away
from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.
“Come in!” said he.
The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and
trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming
umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce
weather through which he had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the
lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is
weighed down with some great anxiety.
“I owe you an **apology**,” he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes. “I trust that I am
not intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug
chamber.”
“Give me your coat and umbrella,” said Holmes. “They may rest here on the hook and
will be dry presently. You have come up from the south-west, I see.”
“Yes, from Horsham.”
“That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive.”
“I have come for advice.”
“That is easily got.”
“And help.”
“That is not always so easy.”
“I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in
the Tankerville Club scandal.”
“Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.”
“He said that you could solve anything.”
“He said too much.”
Page 86, Paragraph 1: We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-
boy had run out to the horse’s head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small,
winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a
little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie,
with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure
outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her
eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted
lips, a standing question.
“Well?” she cried, “well?” And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of
hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged
his shoulders.
“No good news?”
“None.”
“No bad?”
“No.”
“Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a long day.”
“This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in several of my
cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him
with this investigation.”
“I am delighted to see you,” said she, pressing my hand warmly. “You will, I am sure,
forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow
which has come so suddenly upon us.”
“My dear madam,” said I, “I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can very well see
that no **apology** is needed. If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here,
I shall be indeed happy.”
“Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the
table of which a cold supper had been laid out, “I should very much like to ask you one or
two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer.”
“Certainly, madam.”
“Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. I simply wish
to hear your real, real opinion.”
“Upon what point?”
“In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?”
Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. “Frankly, now!” she
repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a
basket-chair.
“Frankly, then, madam, I do not.”
“You think that he is dead?”
Page 149, Paragraph 1: “She walked into the breakfast-room.”
“On your arm?”
“No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat
down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of **apology**, and left
the room. She never came back.”
“But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her
bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.”
“Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora
Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr.
Doran’s house that morning.”
“Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her.”
Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. “We have been on a
friendly footing for some years—I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at
the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint
against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but
exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when
she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the
marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church.
She came to Mr. Doran’s door just after we returned, and she endeavored to push her way
in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had
foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in
private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there
was no good in making a row.”
“Did your wife hear all this?”
“No, thank goodness, she did not.”
“And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?”
“Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought
that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her.”
“Well, it is a possible supposition.”
“You think so, too?”
“I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?”
“I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.”
“Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to
what took place?”
“Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts.
Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the
excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride,
had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.”
Page 154, Paragraph 1: “You’re angry, Robert,” said she. “Well, I guess you have every cause to be.”
“Pray make no **apology** to me,” said Lord St. Simon bitterly.
“Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you
before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I
just didn’t know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn’t fall down and do a
faint right there before the altar.”
“Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you
explain this matter?”
“If I may give an opinion,” remarked the strange gentleman, “we’ve had just a little too
much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like all Europe and
America to hear the rights of it.” He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a
sharp face and alert manner.
“Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady. “Frank here and I met in ‘84, in
McQuire’s camp, near the Rockies, where pa was working a claim. We were engaged to
each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while
poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer pa grew the
poorer was Frank; so at last pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he
took me away to ‘Frisco. Frank wouldn’t throw up his hand, though; so he followed me
there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it. It would only have made him
mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and
make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa. So then I
promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else
while he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t we be married right away, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will
feel sure of you; and I won’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’ Well, we talked
it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we
just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to pa.
“The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in
Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper
story about how a miners’ camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my
Frank’s name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after.
Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in ‘Frisco. Not a word of news
came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord
St. Simon came to ‘Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and pa
was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place
in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.
“Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I’d have done my duty by him. We can’t
command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention
to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt
when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking
at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there
he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or
sorry to see him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the
words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn’t know what to
Page 170, Paragraph 1: “I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,” said he. “Only two days ago I
was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely
and dishonored age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary,
has deserted me.”
“Deserted you?”
“Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me
lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she
had married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me
to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:
“‘MY DEAREST UNCLE:—I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had
acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this
thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you
forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not
search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I
am ever your loving MARY.’
“What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?”
“No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder,
that you are nearing the end of your troubles.”
“Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something!
Where are the gems?”
“You would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum for them?”
“I would pay ten.”
“That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And there is a little
reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for 4000
pounds.”
With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to his
desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down
upon the table.
With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.
“You have it!” he gasped. “I am saved! I am saved!”
The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered
gems to his bosom.
“There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,” said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.
“Owe!” He caught up a pen. “Name the sum, and I will pay it.”
“No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble **apology** to that noble lad, your son,
who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I
ever chance to have one.”
“Then it was not Arthur who took them?”
Page 191, Paragraph 1: “Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said Mrs. Toller serenely.
“And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a
ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out.”
“You have it, sir, just as it happened.”
“I am sure we owe you an **apology**, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes, “for you have certainly
cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs.
Rucastle, so I think. Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it
seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one.”
And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of
the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through
the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so
much of Rucastle’s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and
Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight,
and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to
Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further
interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is
now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with
considerable success.
